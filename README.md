OpenVALIDATION enables you to generate validation rules from natural language-like expressions in English and German without any knowledge in programming.
The validation rules can be automatically translated by openVALIDATION into Java, JavaScript, C# or Python, with more languages to come!

# Getting Started

This readme provides a brief overview. For more details check out our [documentation and guides](https://docs.openvalidation.io), or try it out directly in the browser on the [playground](http://playground.openvalidation.io/#/).

### Download & Installation
Download the [openVALIDATION CLI](https://downloadarchive.blob.core.windows.net/openvalidation-generator/openvalidation.jar) (requires the Java SE 8 runtime environment).

The openVALIDATION Java API is also available via the Maven Central Repository. Add this to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.openvalidation</groupId>
        <artifactId>openvalidation-core</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
    </dependency>
```
For now openVALIDATION is developed and tested for `jdk 1.8.*` only.

Via the [Sonatype snapshot repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots) you can download a snapshot of the current state of the upcoming version of openVALIDATION.

### Using the CLI
We will use the rule `your age HAS to be greater than 22` to validate data of the form `{ age: 21 }`. The rule will be translated into code that validates the data according to our defined rule.
```bash
java -jar openvalidation-cli/target/openvalidation.jar --culture en --language javascript \
     --rule "your age HAS to be greater than 22" --schema "{ age: 21 }" --output age_check.js
```
If you check `age_check.js` you will see the generated code:
```js
var HUMLValidator = function() {
    var huml = new HUMLFramework();
            huml.appendRule("",
                   ["age"],
                   "your age HAS to be greater than 22",
                   function(model) { return huml.LESS_OR_EQUALS(model.age, 22.0); },
                   false
                );
    this.validate = function(model){
        return huml.validate(model);
    }
}
```
As this is a validation rule, we will throw an error *"your age HAS to be greater than 22"* if the criteria specified in the rule are not met.

Besides raw strings the `--rule` flag also accepts paths to files containing the rules.

The `--schema` flag also accepts paths to files containing the data (like YAML or JSON) or URLs to websites containing the raw data.

# Features

The construction of an openVALIDATION ruleset is fairly simple. Each ruleset is made up of of 3 basic kinds of elements: *validation rules*, *variables* and alternatively *comments*. This set of elements allows you to construct complex rulesets which you can use to customise the validation of data as you like. To get a better feeling for how they interact, take a look at the examples below.

## Rules

Rules are the heart of every ruleset and consist of two parts:
 - An error message that is displayed if the data does not conform to the rule
 - and a condition containing the logic that will trigger the error message if the validation fails.

There are two ways to define a rule. For the first, let\'s take a look at a simple example.

The data to be validated is:
```json
{
    "weather": "cloudy"
}
```
And our rule is:
```
If    the weather is rainy
then  Don't forget your umbrella!
```

As you can see the first kind of rule starts with an `If` followed by its condition containing the validation logic `the weather is rainy` and is concluded by the keyword `then` followed by the error message, in our case `Don't forget your umbrella!`. Notice that the `is` acts as an operator and is only one of many ways to express equality in the openVALIDATION language. The way the words are aligned here only serve illustrative reasons and is by no means necessary. The error is triggered if the condition is true. This rule would roughly translate to:
```javascript
if(model.getWeather() == "rainy")
{
    throw new Exception("Don't forget your umbrella!");
}
```

Additionally, there is a second way to express rules in openVALIDATION. Let's have another look at an example:
```
The weather must be rainy.
```
This kind of rule is special in the way that it contains the keyword `must` and lacks an error message. However, *the whole rule itself can be seen as the error message*. In fact, an explicit error message initiated by a `then` is not allowed in this case. The `must` operator implies an equality operator between `weather` and `rainy`. Another very important trait of this sort of rule is the way its logic translates into code compared to an `if-then-rule`:
```javascript
if(model.getWeather() != "rainy")
{
    throw new Exception("The weather must be rainy.");
}
``` 
The most important difference is, that the implied equality is negated when translated.

Furthermore, it is possible to construct complex condition groups (by using `and` and `or`) and build conditions from arithmetic expressions, lambdas, variable references and other property accessors (like `weather`).

## Variables

Variables can be used to hold simple values or store complex expressions. Each variable ends on the keyword `as` followed by its name:
```
today's weather is sunny as sunny_day
```
The condition `weather == sunny` is now known under the name `sunny_day` and can be used in multiple other instances, e.g. in a rule:
```
If    today is a sunny_day 
then  Sunscreen is important!
```

# Code generation parameters
For generation of Java and C# code, openVALIDATION needs type information about the data that is to be validated in order to create compilable source code.

The CLI has the following ``-p``-Parameters to provide information about a Java or C# class that defines the data model:

- model_type: Name of the Model class used in validation Rules
- model_type_namespace: Namespace or package of model_type class. In Java, this must include the Name of model_type.
- generated_class_namespace: defines the namespace or package of the generated Validator and Framework. if this is not set, a namespace or package called ``Validation`` will be created.

Set name and value with ``name=value`` and concatenate multiple options with ``;``, 
like: 
```cmd
-p "model_type=Model;generated_class_namespace=OpenValidationFramework_CSharp;model_type_namespace=OpenValidationFramework_CSharp.Data"
```
