            **Changes in `pom.xml`! Check `<version>` fields and `revision` property before rebasing and merging**,
            as that will trigger an automatic deployment! All version entries should be `$(revision)`, and for non-release PRs
            the revision property should be`{upcoming version}-SNAPSHOT`!
